# MyProject
This is a website to help a friend with his car repair business.

To run, just copy whole myProjectFinal folder and then run newIndex.html file.

The partsPage is still under construction, working to get JSON CDN from rawgit working together.

The next step after finishing the parts page is to increase functionality with google map.

Thanks for  taking a look and I welcome your comments.
